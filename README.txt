DESCRIPTION

  The Scalable JavaScript Application framework is a client-side library
  used to create modular Web applications. It is based on the Scalable
  JavaScript Application Architecture [1] by Nicholas Zakas.

FIRST STEPS

  The design of the framework is described in Design Patterns for Scalable
  JavaScript Application [2], which you can find in doc/ folder of the project.

  After installing the required software (see the requirements section below),
  run Apache Ant in the build folder to generate the API documentation and the
  combined/minified script for deployment.

  For debugging, you may use another version of the script which contains the
  whole code in a single file including long identifiers, indentation and
  comments: build/out/js/lb-full.js (5 times bigger).

  The HTML documentation of the Application Programming Interface is generated
  in the folder build/out/doc. The script generated for deployment is located
  at build/out/js/lb-min.js.

  After understanding the underlying principles [1] and reading the design
  document [2], you should start digging the generated HTML API [4], starting
  with the Sandbox build/out/doc/files/lb-core-Sandbox-js.html and the Core
  Application build/out/doc/files/lb-core-application-js.html

  For the purpose of Semantic Versioning [3], the public API of this library
  comprises all modules and methods in the lb.core namespace. The details of
  the modules in lb.base, a layer for cross-browser compatibility, are
  implementation specific and may vary from version to version.

LEARN MORE

  The framework has been presented at ParisJS #6, on April 27th, 2011.
  You can find the slides of the presentation on GitHub [5] or watch
  the videos of the presentation [6][7] (in French).

REQUIREMENTS

  The following software is required for the build process which generates the
  API documentation, checks the syntax of source files and produces a combined
  and minified version of the library for deployment. The versions that I used
  are indicated in parenthesis.

  http://ant.apache.org/

  * Java JDK (OpenJDK 1.6.0 on Linux, Sun JDK 1.6.0 on Windows)
  http://openjdk.java.net/
  http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

  * perl (5.10.0 on Linux, 5.10.1 with ActivePerl on Windows)
  http://www.perl.org/
  http://www.activestate.com/activeperl

  * OpenOffice.org Writer (3.2.0) for the design document
